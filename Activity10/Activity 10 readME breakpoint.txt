Screen shot of break point is to illistrate where the program was breaking when run with provided code.
Based off of that breakpoint is where I analysed the code. Once I changed it to get it to run. The output
was showing the Calue of A being depicted as the union. That is where the idea of using a copy Set() to 
hold the unionized data came from.
