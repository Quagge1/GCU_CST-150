I put in a try catch block for exception handling on Activity 2 as directed by the Activity 6 instructions.
The try block starts on  line 15, catch on line 27. This is a really simple program so there should be
no exceptions thrown since it will execute as designed. I also change the variable names to not be so
deciving.
